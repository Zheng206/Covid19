# COVID-19 Spread Simulation

This study is based on Gang Xie's paper 'A novel Monte carlo simulation procedure for modelling COVID-19 spread over time' (2020), aiming to develop a COVID-19 spread dynamics model that can be used as a decision making tool for disease control.The proposed method is characterized by a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which captured infection rate and population changes, and treated each individual in a population as a random point.
